# Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection involves identifying rare items, events, or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. This can be crucial for identifying fraudulent activities, network security breaches, or manufacturing defects.

## Methods
- **Statistical Methods**: Basic statistical benchmarks can be used to flag anomalies in data distributions.
- **Machine Learning Based Approaches**: Includes clustering-based techniques like DBSCAN, isolation forests, and neural networks designed for anomaly recognition.

## Applications
- Fraud detection in banking and insurance.
- Intrusion detection for cybersecurity.
- Fault detection in manufacturing processes.
